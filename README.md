## About Me  
I’m a clinician–data scientist with a background spanning medicine, nursing, and defense analytics.  
Previously, I supported the U.S. Department of Defense, building predictive models and decision-support tools for biomedical and operational missions.  
My focus now is applying reproducible data science to surgical and neurosurgical outcomes research, partnering with faculty at the University of New Mexico.
